Blogging has been one of those things that's cropped up from time to time. I must've started 3 or 4, but they all seem to go the same way. You start off invested. Determined. Focused. That only goes so far, though. It never seems to take too long for that to fade away, resulting in what I'm classing as a _binge and purge_ cycle.

Anyway, here we are again. I make no promises that this time will be any different, but I'm quite invested in certain things at the moment and it seemed like as good a time as any to share my thoughts / opinions / musings on these. 

Basically I'm going to see how things go. I may muddle in some _vlogs_ along the way, but I'm really not a fan of public speaking. I could never take drama class or anything of that ilk seriously when I was younger, it always seemed to make you feel like a bit of a tit. But I'm not ruling it out!
