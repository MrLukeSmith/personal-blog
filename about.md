My name is Luke. I'm 26 years young. At the time of writing, anyway. If this follows a similar binge and purge cycle to other blogging efforts, I could be in my 30's now... 

Anyway, I've had this odd desire to start _blogging_ about certain topics. So, here we are. I'd actually like to start _vlogging_, but I'm really not one for public speaking. I'm not sure I could talk into a camera without feeling awkward af.

I'm giving [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a whirl for this, hopefully it'll be sufficient. Standard *Watch this space* moment.
